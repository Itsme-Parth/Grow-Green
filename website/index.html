        <p>Off the top of your head, can you name 3 local businesses in your area? If you can’t, don’t be surprised. As
          the
          COVID-19 pandemic continues, conglomerates are taking over the commerce world with their online prescence,
          strong
          branding, and variety of offerings, leaving small businesses behind in the dust. With GrowGreen, you can
          easily
          learn
          about and find small businesses nearby, and save your favorite ones, so you can revisit them later.</p>
